# RSA-Project

This is a simple implementation of an RSA algorithm in C++ as an assignment for CSCI 411 at CSU Chico. It serves as a proof of concept and as an opportunity for the class to research an algorithm that interested us and implement a basic version. I'm interested in security and encryption, so I chose to research RSA.
